# Exploring and Analyzing Healthcare Trends in Synthetic Medicare Data

## Summary
This project aims to explore healthcare service utilization and demand based on patients demographic and outcomes. This thorough examination attempts to break down all the different facets of American healthcare, such as health conditions, provider availability, geographic disparities, demographic insights, and financial burdens related to healthcare services. The report offers a comprehensive assessment of the current status of healthcare in the country by carefully examining death trends, state-specific health outcomes, healthcare provider distribution, common medical conditions, treatment patterns, and the financial aspects of healthcare.

### This is a Course Final Project Report Repository for the course QST IS843 (Big Data Analytics for Business)

## Data Source:
- Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Synthetic Patient Data
- The CMS Synthetic Patient Data in BigQuery offers a simulated snapshot of Medicare insurance claims from 2008-2010. It includes anonymized information on 2.33 million patients, encompassing diagnoses, procedures, medications, encounters, and provider details. While not reflecting real individuals, this data allows researchers to explore healthcare trends and patterns related to disease prevalence, mortality rates, provider analysis, and cost analysis.

## Motivation:
As the healthcare landscape continues to change, characterized by increasing costs, varying disease prevalence, and demographic shifts, we think itâ€™s crucial to understand and optimize healthcare services across various settings and populations. Our motivation is to help the US healthcare system in improving the delivery of healthcare and the distribution of resources.
